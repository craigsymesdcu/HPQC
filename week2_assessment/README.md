# Week 2 practical

How to run the code 

time_print_write_to_file.py 
must be executed from a directory that conatains "results.txt"
you will have to manully delete the results form "results.txt2 every time

time_print_read_from_file.py 
must be executed from a directory that conatains "results.txt"
It will read everything in the file

time_print_write_to_file.c 
must be executed from a directory that conatains "results.txt"
you will have to manully delete the results form "results.txt2 every time

#time_print_read_from_file.c
must be executed from a directory that conatains "results.txt"
It will read everything in the file

Evaluate your results

Hello World 

python times :
real    0m0.032s
user    0m0.023s
sys     0m0.008s

C times :
real    0m0.015s
user    0m0.002s
sys     0m0.000s

The real times are greater that the user .The system time were the smallest. The C code was faster than the python3 code.

Repeat Adder

When both number were small the times were less than 0.17 seconds.
With one big number and one small number the times were less that 0.04 seconds.
Two big numbers resulted in times close to zero.
